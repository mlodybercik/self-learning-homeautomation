abstract = {A smart home inhabitant performs a unique pattern or sequence of tasks repeatedly. Thus, a machine learning approach will be required to build an intelligent network of home appliances, and the algorithm should respond quickly to execute the decision. This study proposes a decision tree-based machine learning approach for predicting the activities using different appliances such as state, locations and time. A noise filter is employed to remove unwanted data and generate task sequences, and dual state properties of a home appliance are utilized to extract episodes from the sequence. An incremental decision tree approach was taken to reduce execution time. The algorithm was tested using a well-known smart home dataset from MavLab. The experimental results showed that the algorithm successfully extracted 689 predictions and their location at 90\% accuracy, and the total execution time was 94 s, which is less than that of existing methods. A hardware prototype was designed using Raspberry Pi 2 B to validate the proposed prediction system. The general-purpose input-output (GPIO) interfaces of Raspberry Pi 2 B were used to communicate with the prototype testbed and showed that the algorithm successfully predicted the next activities.},

abstract={The idea of a smart home is getting attention for the last few years. The key challenges in a smart home are intelligent decision making, secure identification, and authentication of the IoT devices, continuous connectivity, data security, and privacy issues. The existing systems are targeting one or two of these issues whereas a smart home automation system that is not only secure but also has intelligent decision making and analytical abilities is the need of time. In this paper, we present a novel idea of a smart home that uses a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine) for intelligent decision making and also uses blockchain technology to ensure identification and authentication of the IoT devices. Emerging blockchain technology plays a vital role by providing a reliable, secure, and decentralized mechanism for identification and authentication of the IoT devices used in the proposed home automation system. Moreover, the SVM classifier is applied to classify the status of devices used in the proposed smart home automation system into one of the two categories, i.e., {\&}{\#}x201c;ON{\&}{\#}x201d; and {\&}{\#}x201c;OFF.{\&}{\#}x201d; This system is based on Raspberry Pi, 5{\&}{\#}x2009;V relay circuit, and some sensors. A mobile application is developed using the Android platform. Raspberry Pi acting as the server maintains the database of each appliance. The HTTP web interface and apache server are used for communication among the Android app and Raspberry Pi. The proposed idea is tested in the lab and real life to validate its effectiveness and usefulness. It is also ensured that the hardware and technology used in the proposed idea are cheap, easily available, and replicable. The experimental results highlight its significance and validate the proof of the concept.},

abstract = {The convolution neural network is gaining a lot of popularity in image classification problems nowadays. It has been used in many different classification problems, like medical imaging, handwritten digits, image classification, etc. It is very critical to estimate the time required by the model to achieve the desired task. Earlier studies have used CNN for different perspectives and given the depth of each layer of CNN, but estimating the time and space taken by these layers is missing. This paper's prime idea is to find a CNN model's time complexity. The present work involves computational studies to find the factors that affect the model's performance, the time each layer takes to run, and how it affects the model's overall performance. Time complexity has been discovered on eight different models, varying by the size of filters, number of convolutional layers, number of filters, number of fully connected layers, and kernel size. The result shows that factors like an optimizer, batch size, filter, and neurons greatly impact the time taken by the model. The convolutional layers, max pool, and fully connected layers directly affect the performance of the model.}
